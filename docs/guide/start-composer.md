Configuring Composer
====================

After the project template is installed it's a good idea to adjust default `composer.json` that can be found in the root
directory.

First we're updating basic information. Change `name`, `description`, `keywords`, `homepage` and `support` to match
your project.

Now the interesting part. You can add more packages your application needs to the `require` section.
All these packages are coming from [packagist.org](https://packagist.org/) so feel free to browse the website for useful code.

After your `composer.json` is changed you can run `composer update --prefer-dist`, wait till packages are downloaded and
installed and then just use them. Autoloading of classes will be handled automatically.
